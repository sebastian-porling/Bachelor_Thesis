   abstract = {In today’s digital and mobile world it is more important than ever that companies offer a mobile solution for their costumers. Deciding which mobile solution to implement can be difficult. The purpose of this study is therefore to make this decision easier. Two mobile solutions, web apps and native apps, were compared in order to identify the most important factors that differentiate the two. By assigning the two mobile solutions one score each for every factor, we created a multi-criteria decision-making model. The model was then evaluated, improved and implemented as a decision-making tool. The second evaluation showed that the majority of the respondents agreed with the decision-making tool, suggesting that it could be applied as a recommendation for companies choosing between developing a native app and a web app. },
